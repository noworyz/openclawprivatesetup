## Questions We Get

### Q: How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI assistants?
**A:** Those are generic tools trained on the internet. Your OpenClaw assistant is private, runs on your infrastructure, and is configured specifically for how *you* work. It knows your context, your preferences, and your business — out of the box.

### Q: What do I need to provide?
**A:** Just 15 minutes on a discovery call. We'll ask about your tools (calendar, email, etc.), your workflow, and what you want to delegate. We handle everything else.

### Q: Is my data private?
**A:** Completely. Your AI runs on infrastructure you control. Your conversations, documents, and data never touch shared servers or train anyone else's models.

### Q: How long until I'm up and running?
**A:** Most clients are live within 48 hours of the discovery call. Complex setups with many integrations may take slightly longer.

### Q: What if I need help after setup?
**A:** We include a hands-on onboarding session and 30 days of priority support. Extended support packages are available for clients who want ongoing optimization.

## 📝 DESIGNER NOTES

**Overall tone:** Premium but human. Think luxury concierge, not corporate enterprise software.

**Color palette suggestion:** Deep navy or charcoal primary. Gold or warm accent. Plenty of white space.

**Typography:** Modern serif for headlines (authority), clean sans-serif for body (readability).

**Imagery:** Abstract, minimal. Avoid stock photos of people at computers. Consider subtle geometric patterns or gradients.

**Mobile:** All sections should stack cleanly. CTAs should be thumb-friendly.

## 3. Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Email to Founder/Exec

**Subject:** In-person OpenClaw setup in Dallas — < 24 hours

Hey [Name],

Saw you're [building X / running Y] here in Dallas. Quick question:

Have you tried setting up an AI assistant like OpenClaw? It's incredible when it works — but the setup takes 10-20 hours if you DIY.

I offer white-glove OpenClaw deployment for founders and execs: $1,000, live in under 24 hours, includes 15 days of support. I handle all the security hardening, integrations, and training.

**I'm based in Dallas and do in-person setups.**

Worth a 15-min call? Here's my calendar: https://cal.com/tavleen-singh-gem3fe/introductory-discovery-call

P.S. OpenClaw is open-source (free), but secure setup is where most people get stuck. That's what I solve.

## 5. LinkedIn Launch Post Draft

**Post:**

I just launched something I wish existed when I was setting up my own AI assistant.

**OpenClaw Private Setup** — white-glove AI assistant deployment for busy founders and execs.

Here's the problem: OpenClaw is an incredible open-source AI assistant. It can manage your email, calendar, and workflows 24/7. But setting it up properly? That takes 10-20 hours of configuration, security hardening, and debugging.

Most execs don't have that time. So they either:
- Skip it entirely
- Set it up insecurely
- Pay an engineer to figure it out

I built this service because I've done the hard work already. For $1,000, I'll:
✅ Deploy OpenClaw securely on your hardware (or a VPS)
✅ Configure all your integrations
✅ Train it on your context
✅ Get you live in under 24 hours
✅ Provide 15 days of white-glove support

Based in Dallas — in-person setup available.

If you're drowning in email and wish you had a 24/7 AI chief of staff, let's talk.
